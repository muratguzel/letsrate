## Instructions

### Install

Add the letsrate gem into your Gemfile

	gem 'letsrate'
	
### Generate

	rails g letsrate User

The generator takes one argument which is the name of your existing devise user model UserModelName. This is necessary to bind the user and rating datas.
Also the generator copies necessary files (jquery raty plugin files, star icons and javascripts)

Example: 

Suppose you will have a devise user model which name is User. The devise generator and letsrate generator should be like below

	rails g devise:install
	rails g devise user

	rails g letsrate user # => user is the model generated by devise
   
This generator will create Rate and RatingCache models and link to your user model. 

### Prepare

I suppose you have a car model 

	rails g model car name:string

You should add the letsrate_rateable function with its dimensions option. You can add multiple dimensions.

	class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
		letsrate_rateable "speed", "engine", "price"
	end                                                         
	
Then you need to add a call letsrate_rater in the user model. 

	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
		letsrate_rater
	end   
	
	
### Using

There is a helper method which name is rating_for to add the star links. By default rating_for will display the average rating and accept the 
new rating value from authenticated user. 

	#show.html.erb -> /cars/1
	
	Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed" %>
	Engine : <%= rating_for @car, "engine" %>
	Price : <%= rating_for @car, "price" %>

If you need to change the star number, you should use star option like below.
	
	Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "speed", :star => 10 %>
	Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "engine", :star => 7 %>
	Speed : <%= rating_for @car, "price" %>
   
### Important 

By default rating_for tries to call devise current_user method as the rater instance in the rater_controller.rb file. You can change the current_user method 
as you will.

	#rater_controller.rb
	
	def create                                  
    	if current_user.present?
	      obj = eval "#{params[:klass]}.find(#{params[:id]})"     
	      if params[:dimension].present?
	        obj.rate params[:score].to_i, current_user.id, "#{params[:dimension]}"       
	      else
	        obj.rate params[:score].to_i, current_user.id 
	      end

	      render :json => true 
	    else
	      render :json => false        
	    end
	end
